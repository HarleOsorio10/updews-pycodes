The first one, RPAG-with_trending_alert.py, creates a dataframe (last line in the file, line 604)
needed for the Alert Level visualization in the website. It outputs a dataframe with the first column
having the sensor names and the first row having the timestamps of alerts starting from 24h before
the current time up to the current time with a 30mn interval. The web visualization for this dataframe
can be seen on the excel file attached with this email.

The second one, Rainfall.py, creates a dataframe (last uncommented line in the file, line 127) needed
for the Rainfall visualization in the website for both the old and current sites. It outputs a normalized
dataframe with respect to half the value of 2yr maximuim rainfall per site. The first column of the
dataframe shows the timestamp and the first row shows the site codenames. The web visualization for this
dataframe can be seen on the excel file attached with this email. 
***(you can change the get_NOAH() function in the file so that it would take the NOAH data directly
 from the web rather than reading the csv files downloaded from rainDownload.py which is also in the Data Analysis folder)***
